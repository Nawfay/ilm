We spend our lives running from it.  
Building routines.  
Earning names.  
Fighting entropy with order.  
But death is the only thing that keeps life honest.

Death is not a flaw in the system — it *is* the system.  
Imagine living forever: every joy would dull, every meaning would decay.  
What gives love urgency? Time.  
What makes now matter? The end.

To die is to be complete.  
Not a tragedy — but the final punctuation mark to a well-written sentence.  
Even if your page was short, even if your story was messy.

Some fear death because they love life.  
But the truth is: life has meaning *because* it ends.  
Death is the invisible companion walking beside us,  
making sure we notice the flowers.

Without death, there would be no reason to do anything today.

## A Reflection on Mortality

> “It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.” — *Marcus Aurelius*

Here’s a video I often return to when thinking about impermanence:

Let death not be the enemy.  
Let it be the horizon that reminds us to move.

*– A fellow impermanent*
